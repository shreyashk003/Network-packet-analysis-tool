# Network-packet-analysis-tool
Packet Sniffing and Pcappng Analysis
This is a powerful packet analysis tool built with Python, Flask, npcap, and tshark. It provides a user-friendly interface for capturing, inspecting, and analyzing network packets. Whether you're a network administrator, security professional, or a curious enthusiast, this tool offers a comprehensive set of features to help you understand and troubleshoot network traffic.

Features:
Packet Capture: Capture network packets in real-time or load pcap files for offline analysis. The tool integrates with npcap and tshark, allowing you to capture packets directly from your network interface.

Packet Inspection: View detailed information about captured packets, including source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, protocols, packet lengths, and timestamps. Explore individual packet headers and payloads for in-depth analysis.

Filtering and Sorting: Easily filter and sort packets based on various criteria such as source/destination IP, port, protocol, and more. This enables you to focus on specific types of traffic and identify patterns or anomalies.

Protocol Analysis: Analyze packet-level protocols such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, DNS, and more. Understand protocol behaviors, detect abnormalities, and gain insights into network communication patterns.

Statistics and Visualizations: Generate statistics and visualizations to summarize packet data. Obtain metrics such as packet counts, protocol distribution, traffic patterns, and top talkers. Visualize the data using graphs, charts, and histograms.

Export and Sharing: Export captured packets or analysis results in various formats (PCAP, CSV, JSON) for further investigation or collaboration with peers. Share specific packets or analysis snapshots for troubleshooting or research purposes.
